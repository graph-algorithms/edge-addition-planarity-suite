Test Results for Planarity-Related Graph Algorithms Package, version 2.0.0

= Introduction =

This page provides the results obtained from executing the various algorithms of the Planarity-Related Graph Algorithms package, version 2.0.0.

The graph generator from the Brendan !McKay's nauty package was incorporated for the purposes of testing the planarity-related graph algorithm implementations on all graphs of given orders (numbers of vertices) and sizes (numbers of edges).  This page reports results for each size of graph of order 11.  This includes graphs that have isolated vertices, are disconnected, and have cut vertices, not just graphs that are biconnected.

For each algorithm, every graph is provided, the algorithm is performed, and then an integrity check on the result is performed. Depending on the algorithm, this testing of all 11 vertex graphs takes between 28000 and 46000 seconds on a late 2001 model Windows-based computer with a 2GHz CPU and 1GB memory.  The same results have also been obtained on a similar vintage Intel-based computer running Linux.

The sections below provide the tables for the various algorithms tested, along with further details about each algorithm.  The numerics are intrinsically interesting and also demonstrate various well-known mathematical results.

= Planar Graph Embedding, Drawing and Obstruction Isolation =

The core planar graph embedding algorithm produces a combinatorial planar embedding for each planar graph and a subgraph homeomorphic to K{3,3} or K5 for each non-planar graph.  The integrity test for the planar embedding does an embedding face count, and the integrity test for the non-planar graphs ensures that the result is a subgraph of the original graph and that it does have precisely the structure of a K{3,3} or K5 homeomorph. The table in this section is generated with the following command line:

  * ./planarity.exe -gens -p 11

The table below is also generated as the result of the planar graph drawing algorithm.  The numerics are the same as for the core planarity algorithm, as one would expect, but the algorithm integrity checking is different.  Each non-planar graph is simply ignored. For each planar graph, as the core planarity algorithm runs, key information needed to generate a visibility representation is collected. The embedder post-processing function is defined to generate the visibility representatino, and the integrity check function is augmented to test that in fact none of the vertical or horizontal lines of the visibility representation intersect, except for edge lines meeting up with the lines representing their vertex endpoints.  These results are produced with the following command line:

  * ./planarity.exe -gens -d 11

The column labelled _# OKs_ can be interpreted as the number of planar graphs found.  Notice how this number tapers off to zero after 27 edges, due to the well-known Euler limit of 3n-6 edges for planar graphs (n=11 in these tests).

= Outerplanar Graph Embedding and Obstruction Isolation =

This section reports the results of executing the outerplanarity algorithms on all 11 vertex graphs.  Each outerplanar graph is checked to ensure it is a combinatorial planar embedding, but also that all vertices are on the outer face.  For each non-outerplanar graph, a subgraph homeomorphic to K{2,3} or K4 is obtained.  The integrity check ensures it is a subgraph of the original graph and that it has the structure of a K{2,3} or K4 homeomorph. These results were obtained using the following command-line:

= Searching for a Subgraph Homeomorphic to K{2,3} =

This section reports the results of executing the search for K{2,3} algorithm on all 11 vertex graphs.  The outerplanarity algorithms are used as a basis.  If the graph is found to be outerplanar, then it does not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K{2,3}.  Any time an outerplanarity obstruction is found, it is either the desired subgraph homeomorphic to K{2,3} or it is a subgraph homeomorphic to K4.  In the latter case, several tests are executed to determine whether a desire subgraph homeomorphic to K{2,3} is entangled with the subgraph homeomorphic to K4.  If not, the subgraph homeomorphic to K4 is reduced to a non-obstruction, allowing the outerplanarity algorithm to proceed.  The _# OKs_ column below reports the number of graphs in which a subgraph homeomorphic to K{2,3} was not found.  The _# !NoEmbeds_ column tells the number of graphs in which a subgraph homeomorphic to K{2,3} was found.  The integrity checker would, in this case, then ensure that the result is a subgraph of the original graph and that it has the structure of a K{2,3} homeomorph. These results were obtained using the following command-line:

= Searching for a Subgraph Homeomorphic to K{3,3} =

This section reports the results of executing the search for K{3,3} algorithm on all 11 vertex graphs.  The planarity algorithms are used as a basis.  If the graph is found to be planar, then it does not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K{3,3}.  Any time an planarity obstruction is found, it is either the desired subgraph homeomorphic to K{3,3} or it is a subgraph homeomorphic to K5.  In the latter case, several tests are executed to determine whether a desire subgraph homeomorphic to K{3,3} is entangled with the subgraph homeomorphic to K5.  If not, the subgraph homeomorphic to K5 is reduced to a non-obstruction, allowing the planarity algorithm to proceed.  The _# OKs_ column below reports the number of graphs in which a subgraph homeomorphic to K{3,3} was not found.  The _# !NoEmbeds_ column tells the number of graphs in which a subgraph homeomorphic to K{3,3} was found.  The integrity checker would, in this case, then ensure that the result is a subgraph of the original graph and that it has the structure of a K{3,3} homeomorph. These results were obtained using the following command-line:

  * ./planarity.exe -gens -3 11

It is interesting to note that the _# OKs_ column number tapers to zero after 28 edges, in accordance with the result of Asano that any graph with more than 3n-5 edges is guaranteed to contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K{3,3}.
