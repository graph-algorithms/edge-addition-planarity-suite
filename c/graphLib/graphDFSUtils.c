 gp_CreateDFSTree
 Assigns Depth First Index (DFI) to each vertex.  Also records parent
 of each vertex in the DFS tree, and marks DFS tree edges that go from
 parent to child.  Forward arc cycle edges are also distinguished from
 edges leading from a DFS tree descendant to an ancestor-- both DFS tree
 edges and back arcs.  The forward arcs are moved to the end of the
 adjacency list to make the set easier to find and process.

 NOTE: This is a utility function provided for general use of the graph
 library. The core planarity algorithm uses its own DFS in order to build
 up related data structures at the same time as the DFS tree is created.

 index fields of the vertices.

 NOTE: This function is used by the core planarity algorithm, once its

 gp_ComputeLowpoints()
        leastAncestor(v): min(v, ancestor neighbors of v, excluding parent)
        Lowpoint(v): min(leastAncestor(v), Lowpoint of DFS children of v)

 The Lowpoint of each vertex is computed via a post-order traversal of the
 DFS tree. Lowpoint calculations require leastAncestor calculations, so
 both are computed by this method.

 We push the root of the DFS tree, then we loop while the stack is not empty.
 We pop a vertex; if it is not marked, then we are on our way down the DFS
 tree, so we mark it and push it back on, followed by pushing its
 DFS children.  The next time we pop the node, all of its children
 will have been popped, marked+children pushed, and popped again.  On
 the second pop of the vertex, we can therefore compute the lowpoint
 values based on the childrens' lowpoints and the least ancestor from
 among the edges in the vertex's adjacency list.

 If they have not already been performed, gp_CreateDFSTree() and
 gp_SortVertices() are invoked on the graph, and it is left in the
 sorted state on completion of this method.

 NOTE: This is a utility function provided for general use of the graph
       library. The core planarity algorithm computes leastAncestor during
       its initial DFS, and it computes the lowpoint of each a vertex as
       it embeds the tree edges to its children.
